# UOB High Flux Neutron Facility
**Author:** Max Conroy

This respository contains the starting neutron source files for use in OpenMC simulations of HF-ADNeF at the University of Birmingham.

### Input Card Method
These files are based off of MCNP input cards, where a C++ file is written for various incident proton energies.

### Compiled Source Method
This is a single C++ file that takes a proton energy as an input and samples initial neutron parameters from physical principles.
_Currently a work in progress._

### Usage
If you use this code in your work, please reference it accordingly. I will be writing this up as part of my PhD and will update this github when that happens. Please contact me for more information at m.j.conroy@pgr.bham.ac.uk.
